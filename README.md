## Project Overview

This is a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project to detect dog breeds based on dog pictures! Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Project Motivations

This is a good chance to explore CNN in object detection in pictures and try out different pre-trained layers that is trained in public datasets. By doing this project, we can understand the performance of different CNN architecture 



## Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
```	
git clone https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git
cd dog-project
```

2. Another option is to navigate to the dog_app.ipynb


## Project Structure

We break the jupytor notebook into separate steps:

- Step 0: Import Datasets

- Step 1: Detect Humans

- Step 2: Detect Dogs

- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)

- Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

- Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

- Step 6: Write your Algorithm

- Step 7: Test Your Algorithm

  The results are showing in the dog_app jupytor notebook file.
